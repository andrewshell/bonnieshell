title: What do you worry about?
---

I was quite a worrier when I was young. I worried about my grades in school. I always wanted to please my parents. Later, when I got a job, I worried about doing good work and making deadlines. When I worked at A. B. Dick, I worked in the Accounting Department, and every month when we closed the books, the managers wanted to have their reports on the first Friday of the month. We called it "Crazy Friday". Sometimes, I would even stay late to hand deliver the reports.

Things changed after my father became very ill because he lost his job through no fault of his own. He and a few of the other long-time managers were let go by the owner's son. He apparently had plans to embezzle from his father, so he got rid of the men who would have caught on. When I saw what this did to my dad, I decided that no job was worth your health. I still did a good job, but I did not worry about mistakes; after all, it was only numbers. No one's life was on the line.

Now, I don't worry as much, but I worry about my son and granddaughter. I want them to be safe and healthy. I certainly don't worry about people's opinions about me. I treat people like I would like to be treated. I've always tried to be a good friend if some one doesn't like me - too bad.
