title: Have you ever had a moment that changed the course of your life?

I went to a commercial high school.  Local businesses often requested students to work for them after school and in many instances, asked them to stay on after graduation.  I was one of those students.  In my senior year, I was hired by Guardian Electric.  I worked there for two years.  The neighborhood was changing, and not for the better.  One gentleman always left ten minutes early so he could catch a train to get home.  One day he left, and three guys mugged him.  They beat him pretty badly and stole his seven dollars.

One Saturday morning, I was going to work.  I had about a one-hour bus ride and when I got off one bus, decided to walk four blocks instead of waiting for the transfer bus.  I started to walk, and this black man started honking his horn at me.  I looked over and realized I did not know him.  He wanted me to get in the car with him.  I just kept walking and noticed he made a U-turn so he would be on the same side of the street as I was.  The traffic was light, so I crossed to the other side street.  We kept doing this until I got to the street where my work was located.  I don’t think I ever ran so fast in my life.  Thank goodness the guard was right by the door.  I rang the bell, and he opened it immediately.  He said I looked like I saw a ghost.

My dad was concerned and kept telling me to find a job closer to home.  That year the recession hit, and the company said we had a choice to either have a lay-off or have everyone work four-day weeks.  We opted for a four-day week.  I decided that my day off would be a good time to start looking for a new job.

I was lucky.  I went on one interview and didn’t like the people who worked there.  My second interview was with the A. B. Dick company.  I got the job on the first interview.  Later I heard that the boss who hired me said he thought I was too young (I was 18) and wouldn’t last because I would probably get married in a year and would leave.  I fooled him. I worked there for thirteen years.

If I had not made the change, I would not have all the wonderful friends I still have in my life. especially my best friend, Marge.
