title: Do you believe in ghosts? Have you ever encountered one?
---

I believe in ghosts. Sometimes, they are around, but you don't see them. I have an angel suncatcher on the porch. This suncatcher was falling off the window almost every day. For some reason, I was thinking of my dad for a while, so I said, "Pa, will you stop knocking this angel off the window?" And it hasn't fallen off since.

After my dad passed away, I don't know if it was his ghost or a dream. In the middle of the night, I saw him sitting in a chair in our bedroom, and he told me he felt better than he had in a long time. My dad had been sick for a long time before he died.

My friend Melanie was suffering from cancer. She went for a bone marrow transplant, and while she was still in the hospital, the doctors said she was cancer-free. One night, Melanie came to me (either her ghost or a dream), and she gave me a white rose and told me she was ready to go. It was three o'clock in the morning, and at 7 o'clock, her husband called to tell me Melanie died at 3 o'clock that morning. The cancer was gone, but her heart failed from all the treatments.

Not long ago, I dreamt about a friend I hadn't seen or heard from in many years. It seemed to haunt me, so I looked her up on the Social Security death list and found out that she died.

My sister is a retired hospice nurse, and she said more than once she saw the "Angel of Death" enter a patient's room. She would go into the room to see who had entered but found no one.

A friend of mine bought a home adjacent to Helen Brach's property (the candy heiress). She vanished under suspicious circumstances. When my friend and her husband moved in, the lights would go on and off at all hours of the night. Her husband thought there was a short in the wiring. One afternoon, Pat was waiting for her son-in-law to bring her a package. She was drinking coffee and heard the front door open and close. She put her cup down and went to see who came in. No one was there, and when she returned to the kitchen, her cup was on the counter across from where she left it. She finally said, "Helen, I can't help you," and the strange things stopped happening.

I think there are spirits around us to help us, comfort us, protect us, and maybe just have fun with us.
